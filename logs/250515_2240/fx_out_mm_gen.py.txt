The provided `mm_gen.py` script appears to be a part of a larger project, and I'll summarize its main functionality and logic within the 300-token limit.

**Main Functionality:**
The `mm_gen.py` script is responsible for generating a prompt for a Large Language Model (LLM) based on various input dataframes and configuration. The script is likely used for automating tasks, such as generating text or reports.

**Key Logic:**

1. The script imports necessary modules, including `dataframe` and `llm_router`, which are likely custom modules within the project.
2. The `split_chunks` function is defined to split a list into smaller chunks of size `n`.
3. The `log` function is used to log messages to a specified log file.
4. The `build_strategy_pp` function takes in several dataframes (`repo_df`, `info_df`, `strategy_df`, and `file_chunk`) and returns a prompt for the LLM.
5. The `mm_gen_main` function is the main entry point of the script, but its implementation is not provided.

**Role in the Project Structure:**
The `mm_gen.py` script is part of the `scripts` directory, which contains various Python scripts that perform different tasks. The script is likely used in conjunction with other scripts, such as `dataframe.py` and `llm_router.py`, to achieve the project's goals.

**Linkages and Dependencies:**
The script depends on the `dataframe` and `llm_router` modules, which are likely responsible for data manipulation and interacting with the LLM, respectively. The script also uses configuration files and data stored in the `config`, `results`, and `logs` directories.

Overall, the `mm_gen.py` script plays a crucial role in generating prompts for the LLM based on various input data, and its functionality is likely used in the project's automation workflow.
