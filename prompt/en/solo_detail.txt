Review the code changes in {change} and write a detailed and expressive commit message suitable for a personal or side project.

You can be more flexible with structure and tone, but your message should include:
- A one-line summary of what changed
- A longer explanation of your thought process, why you made the change, and how it works
- Any notes to your future self: caveats, edge cases, ideas for future improvement, or questions you had while working

This commit message is primarily for your own future reference, so feel free to include informal thoughts that would help you quickly recall your reasoning and decisions later.
