Analyze the code changes shown in {change} and write a commit message suitable for a collaborative team project.

Your commit message should follow the Conventional Commit format:
<type>(optional scope): <summary>

Then include an optional body that explains:
- Why this change was made (e.g. bug fix, feature addition, refactor)
- What the key modifications are
- Any additional information that may help team members understand the impact

Choose the most appropriate type (e.g., feat, fix, refactor, chore, docs) and keep the summary concise and meaningful. Write the message in a way that your teammates can quickly understand what changed and why â€” without needing to review the full diff.
